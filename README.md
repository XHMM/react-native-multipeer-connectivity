# react-native-multipeer-connectivity

API wrapper of apple multipeer-connectivity for react-native

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-multipeer-connectivity
npx pod-install
```

Then update your `Info.plist` by adding:
```text
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>[a]</string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
    <string>_[b]._tcp</string>
</array>
```
- `[a]` will be used in the system permission request dialog
- `[b]` is the service name that will be used in our api


## API
```ts
import { initSession } from 'react-native-multipeer-connectivity';
const session = initSession(options);
```

> Copied from the generated .d.ts file:

```ts
type RNPeerID = string;
export interface RNPeer {
  id: RNPeerID;
  displayName: string;
}
export declare enum PeerState {
  notConnected = 0,
  connecting = 1,
  connected = 2
}
export interface InitSessionOptions {
  /**
   * This name will be used for showing when other peers browsed you.
   * The peerâ€™s name must be no longer than 63 bytes in UTF-8 encoding.
   */
  displayName: string;
  /**
   * This is the name corresponding to the value defined in Info.plist
   */
  serviceType: string;
  /**
   * Custom data available to browsers in the `onFoundPeer` event
   *
   * Limitations:
   *  - Object keys cannot contain an equals sign.
   *  - Each key and value must be string, and the key-value pair must be no longer than 255 bytes (total) when encoded in UTF-8 format with an equals sign (=) between the key and the value.
   *  - The total size of the keys and values should be no more than about 400 bytes.
   *
   * Check https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity/mcnearbyserviceadvertiser/1407102-init for detailed explanation.

## Others
This [repo](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-multipeer) did the same thing, but it abandoned and seems not work well with latest react-native versions, so I created this repo.
